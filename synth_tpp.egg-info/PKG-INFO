# synth_tpp

`synth_tpp` is a Python package designed to easily generate synthetic datasets for point process modeling. Inspired by the `hawkesbook` library, it provides flexible tools for simulating temporal point processes, making it ideal for experimentation, benchmarking, and educational purposes.

## Features

- Generate synthetic event sequences for various point process models
- Customizable parameters for dataset generation
- Simple API for integration with machine learning workflows

## Installation
To install the developer edition, after cloning the repo run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/synth_tpp.git
cd synth_tpp
pip install -e .
```

## TPP Object

```python
from synth_tpp.models import LognormalRenewalTPP

# Create a synthetic Lognormal renewal process (mean=1,std=2) sequence with 50 events
tpp = LognormalRenewalTPP([1.0,2.0])
events = tpp.generate_N(50)

print(events[0])  # Print the first event time
```

## Generate TPP Dataset

You can generate a dataset consisting of multiple event sequences and their corresponding observation session times using the following API:

```python
from synth_tpp.generator import generate_dataset_T
from synth_tpp.models import LognormalRenewalTPP

# Define the TPP model. Interarrivals follow LogNormal with mu=1,std=2
tpp = LognormalRenewalTPP([1.0, 2.0])

# Generate a dataset with 100 sequences, each observed for a random time of (50,100)
sequences, session_times = generate_dataset_T(
    model=tpp,
    Tmin=50,
    Tmax=100,
    num_sequences=100
)

print(sequences[0])      # List of event times for the first sequence
print(session_times[0])  # Observation session time for the first sequence
```

- `sequences` is a list of event time arrays, one for each sequence.
- `session_times` is a list of observation session end times for each sequence.

## Supported Models

- Homogeneous Poisson process
- Hawkes process with exponential kernel
- Self-correcting
- Lognormal renewal
